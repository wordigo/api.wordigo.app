"First 50 Intermediate Words in English" is our topic for this json formatsI want from you to create 50 words appropriate for this structure 

"text" is going to our word which you provide to me
"translatedText" is going to translated version of word which you provide to me in Turkish
"nativeLanguage" is going to "en"
"targetLanguage" is going to "tr"

Also we are going to have "level" and "description" fields these are waiting from you chat! 

Firstly "level" property's type is integer and it has some restrictions, these are: 
It can be 1-6 but not float number just integer,
A1 equals 1, A2 equals 2,  B1 equals 3,  B2 equals 4,  C1 equals 5,  C2 equals 6,
it needs to be calculated in this way; firstly you will find all of the words and determine their level one by one and then get the avarage of them to setting the prop.
Also it needs to be in the out of "words" list.

Secondly, "description" prop needs to be a string and description of the topic. Language of "description" property needs to be what the "nativeLanguage" property is.

Can you provide to me these all in format of json and lowercase and title needs to be set as topic then I will use it as request to my backend. And please complete the words according to numbers which I wanted from you.

desired json format -->
